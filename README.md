# PLEX Playlist Import
This is an application written to help PLEX Media Server (PMS) owners import playlists into PLEX.  This is written as a Universal Windows Platform application.  Current builds are for x86 and x64 architectures only. This application is not currently available in the Microsoft Store.

# Motivation
Currently PMS does not have an interface for importing playlists. However, there are exposed endpoints that can be utilized for this purpose.

# Installation
Currently the release is not signed with a certficate.  This is one of the reasons why its not currently on Microsoft Store.  In order to install you need to run the powershell script.
